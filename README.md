## notepad++ autocomplete 

Wrapper around script found here: 

https://gist.github.com/yihui/2143971

## installation 

```r
devtools::install_github("jhnwllr/nppac")
```

## usage 

A file named `R.xml` saves to `C:/Program Files/Notepad++/autoCompletion/`. You might have to **change permissions** on the folder for the script work.  

```r
# load the libraries you want have autocomplete for. 
sapply(c('rgbif','purrr','dplyr', 'ggplot2'), library, character.only = TRUE)

nnp_ac() # save R.xml to dir 
```
